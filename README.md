<h1> Shopping Cart Checkout </h1>

<h2> Problem Description </h2>
<p>In our quest to stay in touch with what's going on in the commercial world we've
decided to open a supermarket - we sell only three products:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Product code </th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Price</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>FR1 </td>
<td>Fruit tea </td>
<td>£3.11</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>SR1 </td>
<td>Strawberries </td>
<td>£5.00</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>CF1 </td>
<td>Coffee </td>
<td>£11.23</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Our CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers. She wants us to add a rule to
apply this rule to fruit tea. </p>
<p>The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries to get a
price discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should
drop to £4.50 each. </p>
<p> Our checkout can scan items in any order. </p>
<p>The CEO and COO change their minds often, so ideally this should be a flexible
solution (if you have time). For example, we might want to apply the offers to
different products, or add products to our range, as the supermarket grows. </p>
<h2> Task </h2>
<p>Your goal is to implement a checkout that scans items in and calculates total prices
correctly for any combination of the products and offers above. </p>
<p> Please don’t spend more than an hour or two on this. </p>
