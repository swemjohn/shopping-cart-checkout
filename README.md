<h1> Shopping Cart Checkout </h1>

<h2> Problem Description </h2>
<p>In our quest to stay in touch with what's going on in the commercial world we've
decided to open a supermarket - we sell only three products:</p>
Product code Name Price
FR1 Fruit tea £3.11
SR1 Strawberries £5.00
CF1 Coffee £11.23

<p>Our CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers. She wants us to add a rule to
apply this rule to fruit tea. </p>
<p>The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries to get a
price discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should
drop to £4.50 each. </p>
<p> Our checkout can scan items in any order. </p>
<p>The CEO and COO change their minds often, so ideally this should be a flexible
solution (if you have time). For example, we might want to apply the offers to
different products, or add products to our range, as the supermarket grows. </p>
<h2> Task </h2>
<p>Your goal is to implement a checkout that scans items in and calculates total prices
correctly for any combination of the products and offers above. </p>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
